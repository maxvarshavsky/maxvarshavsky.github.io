You’re in area 8, you’re told to keep watch, but there were a lot of other people, including your friend, Ian Vemal. There were a lot of dangerous things, like, the unsustainable energy, the radioactive plasma, and all the lights…it was pretty scary, but then…flick! flick! flick!   “POWER DISCONNECTED.” said a very deep voice. You hear commotion around you, suddenly “AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” screamed a voice. “POWER RESTORED.” said a deep voice. Everybody went looking for clues. You found out that Lukey, Marcos, Lennon, and Az-amore died, you also found all their journals. You went to a meeting room, Zatch and Zack were waiting, and a few seconds later, Ian comes back. You say “I found Marcos, Az-more, and Lukey drowned in radioactive plasma, while Lennon, well, he was hanged. What about you, Ian?” Ian said, “I’m the assassin that killed Lennon and Cols.”. Just as he said that Zack said, “I found Cols, it’s strange, how did you know!”
Then Zatch said “I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS!!!! VOTE IAN!!!!!!!!!” but then, you said, “Az-more and Ian are probably clowns! Az-more’s journal says ‘Hello friend, I’ve come to kill you :( HAHAHA )’, and Ian is acting very suspicious”. Even though you said that everybody voted Ian.
